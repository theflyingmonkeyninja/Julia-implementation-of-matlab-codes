# Julia implementation of matlab codes
Boundary element solver for acoustic problems in 2.5D, julia implementation of matlab codes of my thesis. Although the matlab codes were extensively validated these codes are not. For validation purposes of these codes, the test cases and the related physics of them can be found in my thesis.
The codes serve as a starting point for development of open source implementation of boundary element solver for acoustics.
