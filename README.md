# Julia implementation of matlab codes
Boundary element solver for acoustic problems in 2.5D, julia implementation of matlab codes of my thesis. Although the matlab codes were extensively validated these codes are not. Debbuging needs to be done and the debuggers are refered to my thesis for validation purposes of these codes as the physics of the problem can be found in my thesis.
The codes serve as a starting point for development of open source implementation of boundary element solver for acoustics.
