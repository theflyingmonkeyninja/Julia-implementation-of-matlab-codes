# Julia implementation of matlab codes
Boundary element solver for acoustic problems in 2.5D, julia implementation of matlab code of my thesis.
The physics of the problem can be found in my thesis.
The codes serve as a starting point for development of open source implementation of boundary element solver for acoustics.
